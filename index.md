### I'm 51 Years Old Tomorrow

Hello World! Well, I missed 11 AM as I had hoped to be here by, but hey, let's
talk about showing up anyway. Being late isn't always enough of an excuse for
not showing up at all. Some things, especially self-imposed disciplinary
things, are very much showing up for even if you're 15 minutes late for them.
Don't get so hung up on precise titles and labels. As I covered in earlier
videos, language lies. In every language lies lies. Lies lie in every language,
and there they lay... in wait. In wait for hyper-literalists and lawyers to
twist and change and rearrange their meaning until you don't know up from down. 

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="UPnk6verFZo" %}

Lock-down taught us a whole bunch of things. I'm sorry it had to be your
generation coming of age in the Alice/Dorothy sense (there are other senses)
during this strange period. However, don't just feel bad for yourself and your
generation. The world is full of magic that only nerds new in my time, and even
then I was about 18 years old before technology became cool enough. Then
everything I learned about tech/magic and loved so much went away. For me, it
was like the Internet and the Web going away the day the Amiga died, singing...

No, won't go there. But it took me maybe 25 years to replace the Amiga in my
heart. This is because I lacked the deep insight about what it was that I was
really in love with with the Amiga computer. It was a particular instance of a
development platform and player device / runtime engine or what have you. It
was a platform like all the various Nintendo devices are platforms. Everything
you learn and know and do is keyed to that platform with absolutely no caring
about you or your life post-platform. Everything expires. All hardware goes
away. No platform is forever. And I went through a long dry spell of the
lacking of love-worthy things (Windows 3.1, 95, MacOS, OS X and MacOS again).

You my daughter are growing up in a world full of magic that can keep the mind
occupied WITHOUT long-form reading. I read when I was your age, only these tiny
1/2-inch thick books like Danny Dunn but they were so ahead of their time
thought-wise (firefly drones in the 1970s) that they fed something in my soul.
My heart sang and such. At around 12 years old I moved onto the thick adult
books, and the easily found magic was limited to JRR Tolkien's Hobbit, Lord of
The Rings and such. Anything else was off the beaten track and risky because
the books were so thick and took such an investment.

Your generation can get its fix of soul-feeding media 1000 different ways I
could only dream of as a child. This includes video conferencing with multiple
people. Even that term conferencing is dated because it sounds so high fallutin
for something that's just built into GMail now. It's commonplace. Online
meetings. That stuff is amazing! I mean I can hardly explain to you how mind
bogglingly incredible today's world is, and how seeing it be the new normal for
your generation is humbling....

And a little scary. It brings to mind Arthur C. Clarke's great quote and
perhaps warning that, and I paraphrase, any sufficiently advanced technology is
going to be indistinguishable from magic... for those who don't understand it.
And how could one person, a mere individual and mortal, ever hope to understand
a laptop or iPhone or even other non-digital devices like cars and airplanes?

The answer is education... pewie! What a terrible label for such an important
thing. We are all machines learning. We are all the very same artificial
intelligences we are trying to create. Doing stuff... having experiences...
being in the game... just showing up... I could go on. There's a Mark Twain
quote 

> The Secret of Getting Ahead is Getting Started

And it's so true! The first baby-step in any endeavor is the most important. In
fact, it's fair to say that every step in any endeavor is your first baby-step,
for actual beginnings and endings are quite blurred in life, and you're only
ever really living in the "now" moment.

I once said to you there is only the now moment, and tried to go on to explain
Einstein's Theory of Relativity, I believe the special case that talks about
our Universe, such as it is. But this bored you silly and you cut me off and
locked in on the words "there is only the now moment" without the context I
tried to give you.

The lesson there is being hyper-literal and talking over someone who's trying
to tell you critical parts of life's game will leave you with the wrong lesson.
Nuance is important. And what I tried to tell you is that in addition to the
now moment, we can also mathematically prove a slight moment before the now
moment and a slight moment after. So it's the now moment and enough of a sample
of what appears to be time to know that at least momentarily in the past and
future are indeed real.

So while the now moment is extra special, we have evidence that some sort of
past and future exists in a very real sense. So learn from the past and pay
attention to the future.

Just don't limit yourself excessively in the now moment, because it's let's say
80% of what's important, with 10% being studying/re-living/learning from the
past, and another 10% planning for or being prepared for or visualizing what
you want the future to be.

That's about right. The ratios may be off a little, but generally you look for
80% of the benefit of any given undertaking from the first 20% of time you
think you may be willing to give to it. That's how you plan for the future. The
future is so uncertain, excessive planning is silly and could leave you with a
worse feeling (in life in general) than if you didn't plan so much, but instead
focused on improving yourself in ways that will serve you no matter what the
future may hold.

Okay, that's it. I don't want to over-do these At Eleven vids. I don't even
know if my child will ever read/discover/whatever these vids. 

I'm not going to talk much about them. I'll just keep pushing them up, using
them to think out loud regarding bringing up a child in this day and age, and
with them in particular in those ways I am actually able to share.

So, that's about it. The secret of getting ahead is getting started.

Overcome the initial inertial resistance in all things... staying in bed all
day. Use visions of the future that appeal to you to entice you into those
small first steps, and try to make each such small step all you're ever doing
so that one day you will have had a mighty journey without ever feeling like
you put so much work into it.

And plan a bit. That'll be another video. How to paint the future with broad
strokes, regardless of the money in your pocket and most other circumstances of
life... because magic. Don't be hyper-literal. Of course there's no such thing
as magic. But there's making sure it continues to be that way in practice in
your life. You will be a slave to technology if you don't learn how to be its
master. Sorry if all that kind of language is not PC these days, but The Matrix
and stuff. The concept of people becoming enslaved can be discussed without it
having to be an insult every time to those populations that have been.

SciFi helps you think in extremes so that in your life you can bracket problems
broadly... part of those broad strokes of painting the future.

Okay, now I'm just getting too abstract and rambling. I tend to do that. So
video over. Later gater!

### Life is a Game of Connect The Dots

Hello World! Hello Adi! 

Well, what do you know! I actually thought about the topic of today's live
broadcast before I started. I think I want to let you hear me type...

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="eFaUFmZ9VmY" %}

Okay so now you can hear me type... and talk. But these are silent
performances. Pushing things through the actual vocal cords changes things. I
want my ideas to flow exactly like when I narrate to myself in my head, and it
has a distinctly different vibe than when I talk out loud, even to you my
YouTube audience. But as I've often said, I do this more for ME than for you...
except maybe now I do it for Adi... At Eleven.

And so... and so... yes, life is a game of connect the dots.

Sometimes the dots are connected to reveal a picture you can paint in, thereby
having achieved the higher levels of the Maslow self-actualization pyramid,
mostly again for your own good... to live life well and to die with fewest open
regrets. But perchance, leave something behind for future generations too in
the form of the "completed" painting.

Nothing's ever really completed. We go back and tweak constantly. Some
achievements are best left as is, freeing up those tweaking resources to forge
ahead onto new things. Do not sacrifice the future on the altar of the past.
Did Star Wars really need to be redone? 

Anyhoo, examples are too numerous in life to enumerate here. The important
thing is to know such a game is going on and adapt your strategy accordingly.

That would probably about do it for this @11 video, huh? Let's see... connect
the dots, what else?

No perfect vision of a future. Remain adaptable. Have a pretty good vision of
the future. Know what things you love.

But how will I know?

You don't really even always know right away. Sometimes it sinks in over time
that something you're doing, some minor part of your life that plays 2nd fiddle
to the "main event" as you tell yourself (and often other people tell you) may
rise to become the main big thing.

Don't worry about those cat fight sounds. It's not as bad as it sounds. It's
Lynnie and Eri and Eri and Lynnie, two little kitties I know... 2 little
kitties I know.

There once was a Billy and Sammy. They have a story. Tell it.

I have lots of stories.

You wouldn't know it Adi, but your dad has led an interesting life.

My dad hardly knew his dad... Jack. Jack died when my dad was only 12 years
old. My dad died when I was only 21 years old. My plan is to extend those
time-ranges, even though I started out late too, having you when I was 40.

That makes the math easy in calculating ages, being born on a "zero" year.
You're welcome.

Anyhoo, most of the things I know are old-school. I just listed to the Funniest
Jokes series on YouTube from George Burns, Cheech and Chong and Jimmy Stuart.

- Jimmy Stuart was from before my time but had the funniest joke
- George Burns was from my Alice in Wonderland ~7 to 12 years old, and I didn't
  understand or appreciate his joke.
- And Cheech and Chong, even though they were around back then are from my
  later years, and they had the funniest one of all.

Few things are what they ever look like at first, on the surface, don't judge a
book by its cover, and all that.

In life's game of connect the dots, the image takes place slowly over a long
period of time, perhaps your whole life.

There will be false starts, false stops and false images being revealed.

A certain sensitivity that the "green arrow" types of life despise will be your
guidance in knowing whether you're on the right track.

The goal here is to:

- Feed your soul
- Make your heart sing
- And perchance leave something behind

And in that order too. Maybe the first 2 are the same. But the 3rd is very
different. Megalomaniacs like every tycoon society covets focus too strongly on
that last point, in fact trying to do it all in their lifetimes rather than
left behind legacies. Folks like Bill Gates are the worst because they're
2-faced copycats, just standing on the shoulders of giants where he knocked off
some other poor chump. Folks like Bezos are a bit better, actually building
something new although as a Philadelphian, I remember CD-Now very well and seem
to recall that was first. Elon Musk come next, being of a much higher quality
than Gates or Bezos, doing things genuinely first, highly disruptive to
fortified and often corrupt industries, and having a wonderful vision of dying
on Mars, but not on impact... even a great sense of humor. Autism will do that.

Remember the scale. Everything's at least on a 2-dimensional scale, like autism
and gender. That scale is often called an axis. On one side you have one thing
and on the other you have the opposite. Think in those extremes in life, but
try to always act in moderation. That will allow you to:

- Always have considered the best & worst case scenarios
- Illuminate some wiser path in-between that can be traveled
- Make you keenly aware of life's "razor edge" we all live on

And finally, things get complex. That 2-dimensional (1, really) becomes more
complex when you introduce another axis. These are called quadrant graphs or
plots or analysis... labels... poo!

Too much to talk about those. But when you connect the dots of life know it's
complex. It's not a sequential process of increasing clarity, but rather a few
steps forward, a few steps back, chasing rabbits down holes, coming back up and
figuring out whether there's anything you found/learned that you should
incorporate into your developing... Uh, art style.

And I guess that's where I'll stop. A bit over 20 minutes... not bad.

Love you lots and lots, Adi of yesterday, today and tomorrow.

What matters most is what's in your mind... but not only. It's all on a scale.
The now moment is worth slightly more than past and future moments, but not so
much so that you should forget or play-down either.

Think! Observe! Actualize. Repeat.

Later Gator.

Loved going go-karting with you yesterday :-)

### VidCon Cancelled, Making the Best, Internal Voice

VidCon in October is cancelled. Boo! But for the safety of their audience I
guess it's the right thing. Gonna keep the trip to Disneyland and Anaheim
anyway. It's time Adi saw the Pacific Ocean, and maybe we'll visit my old
friend Marc Rifkin. I think he's near that part of California.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="aOIWq-H4WRQ" %}

Hmm, okay what next here? I love that jumping around in THIS journal doesn't
risk any proprietary information leak. THAT is one of the valid reasons for not
using one-and-only-one place for important things. You always know where to
look when you do, which is the benefit. But if you're there in a different
context, like publishing publicly, then it's a liability. 

And so... next? I'll keep this short because I have a lot of work to do this
week, and doing these "At Eleven" broadcasts is a lot like lunch break. It
stimulates the mind... always writing, it's the process of narrating your own
life. The old example I'd use is The Wonder Years or Scrubs, but people of this
generation wouldn't get it so I have to find the pop culture equivalent now.
Adi talked with Nat and me about that yesterday, your inner voice, where it
comes from, whether you can turn it on and off and control it, and its
function. As a compulsive journaler and advocate of the observation game, my
heart sung for joy that she initiated that topic. It's the early stages of
super-smartness. 

The "upper brain" (prefrontal neo cortex and all that) processes information
differently than the rest of your lower or more base animal brain. Forcing your
thoughts through it, and therefore the voice centers (BTW, drawing does a
similar thing) forces you to actually... uh... shall we say database index your
experiences. It's not that the experience was actually different, but it WAS
different for you once you journal it or vocally or visually describe it,
because you more greatly recreated the experience in your head than other
people who were near you (or whatever).

This database processing makes you "smarter". Again, it's hard to really call
it smart. It's just that you have greater capability and resources in making
use of that experience. For example, learning from it to make better decisions
later in life because you can look back at it better. It's like reading a book
and learning from it, except that the book is your own life.

THAT is the observation game. I've been talking to Adi about it since she was
old enough to distinguish words. I read the Walrus and The Carpenter to her
even prenatal. This is deep in my psyche. There are so many things you can
learn about life and so many ways to improve the way you live your own life (by
your own standards, by the way) if only you stop and analyze through your own
brain what you just saw.

- Who was the Walrus
- Who was the Carpenter
- What were they up to and why?
- What is the relationship between the two?
- Who is better off and which would you rather be?
- Who are the Oysters?
- Why are the Oysters in that situation and should you feel sorry for them?

The list goes on and obviously part of the observation game is internally
asking questions about what you saw.

And THOSE QUESTIONS are sort of part of your master-list for life. Even though
I'm in THIS MikeAtEleven "journal", I'll show you how important that is to me
based on how I start my personal private everyday journal over in:

    <-- This direction`

And there you have it. It would be way too long of an AtEleven entry to delve
into WHY those are my 3 questions, but in a nutshell:

1. What's Most Broken is a weakest link in the chain analysis
2. Where's the Biggest Bang for the Buck is an 80/20-rule & Rabbit Hole
   analysis.
3. What Plates Need to be Spun is a... well, to answer one metaphor with
   another, a "don't drop the ball" analysis.

So much of life is just maintenance and paranoid pedantic checking that nothing
is going wrong. We live life on the razor's edge, and that razor is always
vibrating. So the less love-worthy parts of life is tending to that fact.
That's why it's 3rd (lest love-worthy) but why it's one of the big 3.

Anyhoo, that's enough for today. Thanks for joining me. Don't forget to
subscribe. And if you're reading this when I'm dead, Adi, I'm never really dead
so long as the memory of me is alive inside of you. I'm a little virtual
simulation running in your prefrontal cortex, actually in either case.

It IS the simulation of course, because simulation is just a label for
something running on a processing... uh... substrate? Whiter it's reality or a
simulation is just a matter of label choice.

Love ya lots and lots!

### Hello to Future At Eleven

Hello World! It's Mike At Eleven!

The purpose of today's video is to get down a bit of the purpose of this site.
It's not just to force a self-lesson in commitment and consistency (which it
is), but it's even more importantly to talk to future-Adi, my <s>daughter</s>
child.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="2zeVobb2QBM" %}

Adi is homeschooled and going through a lot of similar experiences now as the
rest of her generation. Her homeschool experience is suddenly no longer so
unusual, and that's awesome. She's being raised in-part by her YouTube heroes
and we've been to the YouTube convention in Anaheim, CA a few years back before
lockdown. She's now 10 and we'll be coning again this year, but this time there
will be 2 adults and more time at Disney Land. Anyhoo, I digress. Let's talk to
future Adi.

Hi there Kiddo! I already lost you I bet. Every time I try to teach you
something you transition. I've got so much to show and teach and help you with
in life, it's one of the most difficult things that I can't do it in "normal"
talking format. However I get it. The other side is where you homeschool and
you're here in the mountains of PA to relax and chill.

At least when you're doing your YouTubing, it can be while you're actually
tubing down the Delaware River like we did last week, or perhaps on the
trampoline big enough for four in your front yard next to the zipline where you
can zoom down a cable like Batman or Kim Possible, or maybe a nice bonfire in
our front yard in our firepit and so on. There's a treehouse (really a hunter's
chair in the tree) and archery and lots of other little things to show you that
real reality is sometimes just or more interesting than the online stuff. And I
see you get it. Lead by example, not by words. That's been my new mantra and
when quarantine set in, you saw me spring into action to make sure you weren't
having the same shut-in experience as so many from your generation.

Advice? I've got a lot. Who knows if it will even be relevant to your life by
the time you read this, however we all stand on the shoulders of giants. And
it's totally okay to borrow from others to get a point across fast. I do have a
very old webpage that I replublished recently as I migrated my decade(s)?-old
WordPress website over to plain markdown files like the one you see me typing
here. You can find it at...

- https://mikelev.in/learnings/

And there it is! I have a lot of organizing to do. But before I launch into
THAT learning (3 orders for things: sequential, organized and instant), I will
show you this YouTube video that pretty much nails it:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX5fApDbiLU&t=228s

Oops, wrong journal. I have to watch it. I generally like one and only one
place for things to cut down on "search" liability when you set out to do
things. It's good to have one master location where all your important stuff
goes so you always know where to look.

Anyhoo, let's embed that bad boy... or girl... or it. 

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="KX5fApDbiLU" %}

Yay, I'm getting better at my vim copy/pasting. More on THAT later. It's great
to always be getting better at some tools for life which are always going to be
around in greatly unchanged form so you're not losing your skills by no fault
of your own. It's like learning how to draw on real physical media so no one
can take that skill away from you as software interfaces and apps and platforms
change on you over the years. It will happen. Decades of mastery can be wiped
out in moments as companies and developers decide to change everything on you
to force you to "modernize", but really just to re-buy a lot of stuff for the
sake of their profits and earnings.

You own your skills. Don't let anyone take them away from you. They are more
valuable than money in the bank.

Okay, what else? Not much. I'm not going to make these things too long. I'm
going to go finish watching that video myself, but I'm at 15 points of advice
out of 20 of the things you generally don't know about life until it's too
late, and they're so nailing it. 

So let's start out there. Hope that video's still around by the time you're
reading this (if ever). 

Hello Future Adi, my child. I love you so much! I know I referred to you as my
"daughter" up there, and that may trigger you as not gender neutral enough for
this day and age, so from here on even on this site, I'll be referring to you
as my child. Okay, My Child? Later Gater!

### Practicing good Mike At Eleven publishing habits

Hello World! It's Mike At Eleven! I just launched that website yesterday with
the intent of doing some live streaming (or at least content releases) on my
channels (usually YouTube but others soon) at 11:00 AM and PM. And here I am 11
AM the next day... woot! We'll see if it sticks.

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="cgw-20Il3Y4" %}

I'll often do silent journal streaming like this, for I'm sure an audience of
almost no one. But I always have things on my mind and am fine with thinking
out loud to myself, and in this case some potential audience because YouTube
lets me, so hey, why not? It could be the thing that sticks.

Whether or not it sticks, it certainly can be the catalyst for other things.
The first rule of making stuff happen is to capture your ideas and begin the
process of actualizing. An idea is more real merely by virtue of writing it
down. In the information age such as we're in, it actually is real in the sense
that it's published and shared content that's consumed by other people, plaid
back in their heads, and that makes it real in at least the sense that stories
are real. It's no longer locked away.

Okay enough of that. Let's get down to some actual actualization. 1, 2, 3... 1?
Well, it's really the work day and I'm just taking a short break for this. And
so I think through what goes next naturally on this site. I work dramatically
differently from most people, and that makes a lot of difference in how useful
I am professionally and even how I think in my personal life.

For example, vim. Can you imagine just thinking out loud to yourself like this
in VSCode? Where would you begin? Where I begin is in a github repo. It's
actually a git repo that happens to be stored in a private repository on
Github. Many folks treat git and Github like the same thing. They're not.
Github is a community site built up around the git program written by Linus
Torvalds to help with Linux kernel development. Github is a site that sprung up
around the git program because even though git is already a DISTRIBUTED
revision control system, one of the places that's nice to distribute your code
is to a "centralized" location that you can always push to and pull from for
backup, undo and switching machine locations. Forget about developer
collaboration for a moment.

Let me demonstrate...

There! Now all my latest journal changes are in Github. Now I don't actually
publish my daily journal even though I back it up to Github. It's in a private
repo and I only publish excerpts. One place I publish them is to:

    MikeAtEleven.com

HERE! Or soon to be here. How do I do this? I add another vim buffer. Observe:

It's in my 2nd vim buffer now which I can cycle to with:

    :n

Observe...

That was my entry from yesterday. But I want today's entry over there too. And
so today's "At Eleven" video will be about making a 2nd entry. Soon I will type
these things over in that journal (in defiance of my own 1-textfile-for-life
principle) for the sake of the site. 

And I will show you how my vim blogging macro works. But first...

That's "before". In a moment you will see this entry go live over there...

Not yet. I will take the bottom of yesterday's entry from my main journal while
we wait and make the below entry technically complete...

Okay, so today's entry is pushed (so far) and yesterday's complete entry will
be out in a moment. To avoid that in the future, I will always start my Mike At
Eleven ramblings in this journal/repo. Remember, it's a folder on my drive...

And to make vim work a little more like blogging software, I have a macro that
does this:

The macro uses that "Bxginning of Journal" text to do the insert at the top of
this "stream". Changed the spelling here so as to not interfere with the macro.
And so tomorrow I do this...

Or later tonight at 11. You get the idea. Well anyway, that was Mike At Eleven.
Thanks for joining me and don't forget to subscribe.

# Launching MikeAtEleven.com on Github.io

Hello World! This is a silent live stream. I'm planning on getting a new
website registered and hosted with github.io publishing in the next few
minutes. It's all the "new way" for me. Recently I retired my WordPress site at
MikeLev.in and exported all the content as markdown which github.io pushes out.
It's not pretty yet, but it's also no longer on WordPress and besides my Github
membership, I have no hosting costs anymore. 

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="8fgwnY72omg" %}

This is a live performance. Excuse any mistakes. But here we go looking up a
site we would like to register. My aspiration is to do some sort of video every
night or morning AT ELEVEN. So it will be Mike At Eleven. And because I'm
old-school, I'll use .com. I still think it's the best TLD baring any
overriding reasons to do otherwise (like MikeLev.in). 

I may end up starting from this point...

I re-started this live-stream. Getting a hang of how this works. Just installed
OBS and my stream key from YouTube for the first time on this new laptop.
Registered a new domain: Mike At Eleven... mikeateleven.com. Now it's time to
activate it on github.io. 1, 2, 3... 1? Set up the DNS...

Github includes "free" web hosting. You can resolve a domain to a repository
branch. Most people host it at reponame.github.io but or use a
www.registered.com. I actually plan to resolve to the "apex" domain, aka the
registered domain without a www or other subdomain. We do that with a series of
A Records with the "@" symbol as host... Okay we've got our 4 DNS entries. But
it's resolving to Github now with it having no idea where to send the traffic.
So let's do a before/after...

I should have done a before/after BEFORE that. You can now see that it's
resolving to Github. Otherwise it would have been an even more generic error
about no DNS or no site found. Let's make a repo...

I use my Windows Home / github folder so much I default my terminal program to
cd into it. Now I make a new folder there with the same name as the site...

So I simply made a mikeateleven folder, created an index.html file in there and
added it to the repo and committed it. Oh yeah, I also initialized the folder
AS a git repo with git init. So far no actual Github... just git the local
program. Let's push the repo to Github...

We name our branch as main...
We set the address of our remote repo location...
And finally we do our first push that needs a little more info than usual...

After that, you can just use "git push".

Anyway now we tell it's a github.io page. Github recently promoted the feature
onto their submenu...

This is the first time I used a plain index.html. It shouldn't be a problem. If
it is, I'll switch to an index.md (markdown) which will make the jekyll system
kick in.

Okay, a few things. I added the domain through this area which by the way is:

Repo / Settings / Pages

That www warning is not important because we're not using www. We're resolving
the site to the apex domain (no www).

And there we go! We went from just registered domain (moments before this
video) to a Hello World index.html in a few minutes. Recap...

1. We add the 4 github.io DNS entries at our registrar that provides DNS
   services. NameCheap in this case (recently switched everything off of GoDaddy)
2. We create a local repo and then push it up to Github.
3. We go into that Repo's Settings at Github and select Pages and set a few
   things including the registered domain we're using.
4. After a few minutes you can activate "Enforce HTTPS" which makes the site
   more secure and better for SEO (eliminates "2nd version" of the site).

Okay, it's still a very plain text file which you can see from view-source...

That's nothing different than I typed into my text editor vim. But we want to
make it real HTML and also pretty. So we can select a theme.

That won't work on a .html file. It has to be markdown. So we'll git rename
index.html to index.md...

That was weird. Anyway what happened was this...

I accidentally made my git repo at Windows Home / github instead of /reponame.
And so I copied the files I knew belonged in there back in, including the .git
(invisible) directory that gets created when you git init. I also did a git
pull because once you choose a theme and set a domain Github automatically puts
a few files in your repo... so I had to do a git pull before I could commit and
push my local changes. 

I should have pushed while I was explaining all that because it takes a few
minutes for the Github.io Jekyll system to recognize your new .md files and
stylize them. It could be done by now...

See how it all has a look now? Even though the file looks like plain markdown
locally, when you push it there's a system that converts it to richer html.
Okay, let's do our first real entry there. Let's make it this whole entry. I
might change it later, but my plan is to do something like this (live YouTube
broadcast for example) every day at eleven either AM or PM.

It'll take a minute or two for that to push. In the meanwhile I'm going to copy
some files from another repo/site that uses the same theme which takes out the
banner with an override.

That'll take a few minutes to see again, and I tore out the Google Analytics
and favicon.ico link. I'll put them in again soon (another evening) when I add
tracking on that site. But let's see...

And so that's it. I'll try embedding each YouTube video on these pages too if
possible and let this site evolve. Thanks for joining me and don't forget to
