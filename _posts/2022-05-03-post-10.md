Hi Adi. I bought an electric bike that we can throw in the canoe when we go
down the river. This will let us take the canoe down the river. We can start
with just one short trip.

Our time in the Poconos is probably winding down. I will make sure that these
last 2 months are packed with as much good stuff as I can. And even after I
come back to Staten Island to be closer to you, we will find ways to use our
mountain and river skills.
