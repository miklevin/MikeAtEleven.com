Okay, that last post went well, right down to the slugification of a
challenging piece of Python code as the headline (on MikeLevinSEO.com). This
bodes well. However, it's 9:00 AM and it'll be 11:00 AM before you know it, and
I promised my kid that I'd have their artwork up at eleven.

Resonate the music of their life at eleven. Everybody loves to hear their name
at eleven. It's the gift that keeps on giving at eleven. Instill a kind of deep
and abiding internal resiliency at eleven. Keep your word at eleven. Get
started now, before it's eleven. 1, 2, 3... 1?

First I need to finish updating my release system so that it picks up any
changes in the images folder. Okay, done. Next I need to actually keyword the
different images Adi sent me, merely by changing their filenames to something
that reflects what they told me yesterday...

Okay, cd into that folder and do an ls -l:

    adi-as-nezuko-kamado-demon-slayer.jpg
    adicat.jpg
    anime-cat-girl.jpg
    demon-girl-face.jpg
    demon-girl.jpg
    dorothy-hairless-sphynx-cat-dark-lord.jpg
    dual-color-har-womans-face.jpg
    mel.jpg
    murray-the-fury.jpg
    nezuko-kamado-sketch.jpg
    rainbow-sword-warrior.jpg
    rainbow-sword.jpg
    this-bodes-well.jpg

Okay, now run the macro to format it like this:

```markdown

```

Okay, done. Now move it over to MikeAtEleven.com (including THIS post).
